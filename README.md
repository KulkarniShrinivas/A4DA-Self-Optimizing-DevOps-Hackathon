# A4DA: Autonomous Adaptive AI-Powered Development Assistant

A self-optimizing, closed-loop AI agent system designed to automate code quality improvement.

**The A4DA integrates all five core sponsor technologies:**
* **Automation:** **Cline CLI** for autonomous deployment and workflow triggering.
* **Intelligence:** **Kestra's AI Agent** for data analysis, summarization, and generating the crucial **Codebase Health Score** (Reward Signal).
* **Adaptation:** **Oumi RL** uses the health score to fine-tune its advice model, ensuring suggestions get smarter over time.
* **Foundation:** **CodeRabbit** provides the essential code review data source, and **Vercel** hosts the live dashboard output.

This project maximizes efficiency by having AI learn from AI to guide human developers toward better code health.
